SummAiry is a web application that transforms lengthy articles into concise, platform-optimized summaries using AI technology. For this project specifically, I narrowed the audience to real estate investors in Japan who are trying to tap into the growing real estate market in rural parts of the country. Therefore, users input an article URL related to Japanese Real estate and receive summaries tailored for different social media platforms, streamlining content consumption and sharing.

Features include:

- URL input field with real-time validation
- Format selection (Default, LinkedIn, Twitter/X)
- History dropdown menu for accessing previous summaries
- Loading states and error handling
- Platform-specific summary displays



**Backend Development:**

Node.js/Express server architecture
Integration with Google's Gemini AI for intelligent summarization
Cheerio for web scraping and article content extraction
Features include:

- RESTful API endpoints for summary generation and history retrieval
- Axios used to ensure valid URLs
- Article parsing and cleaning algorithms using Cheerio

**Project Impact:**

SummAiry addresses the growing need for efficient content consumption and sharing especially in the exclusive real estate market in Japan. It helps users save time by quickly understanding article content and enables them to share insights across different social media platforms in appropriate formats, encouraging this constant flow of information. The project demonstrates the practical application of AI in content processing while maintaining a focus on user experience/accessibility all while combatting the exclusivity of Japanese real estate data.
