This full-stack web-application was developed using primarily react for the front-end and node for the back end while using services like MongoDB and AWS to host and launch the application and store user data. I also integrated AWS rekognition which uses AI to identify objects of a garage sale and used that to accurately determine market-competitive prices which gave users the ability to list numerous items in their garage sale with a click of a button.
