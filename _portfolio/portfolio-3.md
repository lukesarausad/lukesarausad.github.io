Developed a software solution that predicts future prices of stocks and cryptocurrencies by analyzing financial data and performing sentiment analysis on contemporary news articles. These inputs were integrated into a predictive model to generate future price forecasts for specific stocks and currencies. Utilized APIs from yFinance and the New York Times for seamless data integration. Additionally, designed and implemented data visualizations to effectively communicate the predictions and trends to users.
