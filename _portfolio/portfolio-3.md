This project focuses on predicting future prices of S&P 500 stocks and various cryptocurrencies by analyzing a combination of financial data and contemporary news articles. The core of the project integrates multiple data sources and tools to provide insight into how news sentiment and financial trends might influence future market movements.

Key Components:
Financial Data Analysis:

We utilized the yfinance API to fetch historical financial data for both S&P 500 stocks and cryptocurrencies.
pandas was used to clean, manipulate, and analyze the data, allowing us to derive meaningful patterns and correlations.
For data visualization, matplotlib was employed to graph trends in stock prices, crypto value fluctuations, and other financial indicators, offering a clear picture of market behavior.
Sentiment Analysis:

News articles were fetched using the New York Times API, providing contemporary insights into events and discussions surrounding cryptocurrencies and the stock market.
The VaderSentiment library was used to perform sentiment analysis on the news articles. By classifying articles as having positive, neutral, or negative sentiment, we evaluated how media sentiment could impact market trends.
Machine Learning and AI:

The project explored how large language models (LLMs) could be trained and applied to the finance world, particularly in relation to blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
Throughout the project, we examined how artificial intelligence, coupled with financial data, might predict future market trends and provide strategic insights for investors.
This project provided a deeper understanding of how AI and data science intersect with the finance industry, especially as blockchain and cryptocurrencies continue to evolve.
