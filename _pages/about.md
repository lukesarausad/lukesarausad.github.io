📖 I am a sophomore at the University of Washington studying Computer Science with a concentration in data science, and a minor in business 📖

🖥️ My primary passion is exploring this intersection between finance and software engineering 🖥️

🌎 I am proficient in several languages including Java, python, C, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS 🌎

🤙 If I'm not coding you can probably catch me golfing 🤙
